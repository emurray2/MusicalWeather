# MusicalWeather
An audio plugin which takes live weather conditions and uses them to control music in your DAW.

## How?
I'm planning on using Arduino Uno along with some 433 MHz sensors to send live weather data from my weather station to my computer (and the plugin). I may also implement [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) inside the plugin. This API would be available by default for users who don't have external data inputs.

## Support
- ✅ - AUv3 (Coming soon!)
- ❌ - VST3 (let me know or make a pull request if you want to help out with this 😃!)
